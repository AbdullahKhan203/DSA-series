Q: I am learning about arrays now.which topisc should i learn ?
Ans:-
When learning about arrays in data structures and algorithms (DSA), here are key topics you should cover:

Basic Operations:

Insertion (at the beginning, end, or any index)
Deletion (from the beginning, end, or any index)
Accessing elements
Updating elements
Traversal:

Looping through an array (using loops like for, while, or higher-order methods like map, filter, reduce).
Searching:

Linear Search
Binary Search (for sorted arrays)
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Common Array Problems:

Finding the maximum/minimum element
Reversing an array
Removing duplicates from an array
Rotating an array
Finding pairs or subarrays with specific properties (e.g., sum)
2D Arrays (Matrices):

Traversing 2D arrays
Diagonal traversal, spiral traversal, etc.
Array-Based Data Structures:

Stacks and Queues (using arrays as underlying structures)
These topics will give you a strong foundation in array manipulation and help you solve a variety of coding problems. Do any of these topics stand out that you'd like to dive deeper into?
